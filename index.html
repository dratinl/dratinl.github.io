			<h2>Welcome</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I am a graduate of <font color="red">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</font> with a B.S degree in <font color="red">Interdisciplinary Science</font>. My coursework included classes primarily in <font color="red">Computer Science</font>, Physics and Mathematics which has improved my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I am a flexible individual with the ability to hit the ground running in any environment. My involvement in youth development and education has given me insight into better ways to teach and learn. 
			</p>
			<p>I am a quick learner, and enjoy running face first into a slew of challenges and projects that test my skills.

				<div class="col-sm-4" id="about_lore">
					<div class="row">
						<p> As an individual I have always been passionate about learning and development, and I combine this with a strong curiosity for all things tech. While I strive when planning for multiple contingincies, I have always maintained that the best way to learn something new is, like a bird, to throw yourself into the deep end and 'Learn by Doing'.</p>

<p>A supporting role allows me to function in both a student and teaching role, often taking technical issues and terms and simplifying into basic terms for either myself, clients or other team members. I have always been one to identify and attack the root cause of an issue as opposed to attempting slapdash band-aid solutions over the top for a quick fix. In addition to this, I am huge advocate for documentation and further detailing of potential solutions to be used in collaboration with the team; afterall, a rising tide lifts all boats.</p>

<p>As a hobby and in my free time I take to coaching Youth Soccer Teams in my local community with a focus on teamwork and self improvement. Teamwork and collaboration are ingrained in my core values and it is something I am passionate about in both professional and casual environments. </p>

					<h5>Bachelor - Interdisciplinary Science (Specialization: Computer Science)</h5>
					<h6>I studied as a nuclear engineer for three years before taking a visual basic programming class and changing tracks completely. After that it was two years of back to back to back programming and computer science cramming until graduation. The thought process, method of finding answers and freedom of solution drew me to the field.</h6>
					<h6>My coursework focused on object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms and software development and design. I have taken classes in a wide range of science courses including astro-physics, geology and engineering design.</h6>
					<h6>One thing I realized the more I dove into the subject is how applicable programming and computer science is to all aspects of learning. It provides a different method to learning how to use tools and functions as a means to an end, and is an intuitive way to understand cutting up a difficult problem into smaller steps. In today's age, I believe it could be a fundamental subject to learn for kids as the concepts help directly with mathematic and general scientific problem solving.</h6>

					<h6>I graduated highschool with math and physics being my favorite subjects, but by far the most enjoyable aspect of attending Riordan was being involved with the Marching and Concert band. I had already had experience with playing music, but Scott Souza took that to a whole new level. Somehow he trained a giant group of rambunctious young men into the best highschool marching band San Francisco had to offer. The highlight of my time spent there is performing in the 2010 Giants World Series parade!</h6>

					<h6>This one took me a little bit by surprise. I grew up with soccer and didn't develop an interest in football (read: massive bias against football) until just a couple years ago when some highschool friends decided to start up a fantasy league.</h6>
					<h6>It's just the right amount of competetive and research focused needed to hook me in. The sport also serves as a great resource for programming practice as it deals with a large database of statistics and data manipulation.</h6>

					<h6>I picked up the Alto Saxophone around the 7th grade, but didn't get serious about it until high school where I was a part of the Marching, Concert and Jazz bands. Playing, listening to, and discussing music is therapeutic in nature for me. Music is beautiful because it can be logical, complicated and calculated, but it can also be as simple as a single note. I believe that there are few trades where an amateur can truly appreciate something even with little understanding and it is one of the many beautiful things about music.</h6>
